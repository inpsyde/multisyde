# SiteActiveTheme for MultiSyde

**SiteActiveTheme** is a feature module for the [MultiSyde](https://github.com/inpyde/multisyde) plugin.  
It provides a clear overview of which themes are actively used across your entire WordPress Multisite network.

## How it works

Once enabled as part of MultiSyde:

1. Go to **Network Admin > Sites**.
2. Youâ€™ll see a new column labeled **Active Theme**.
3. For each site, the name and version of the active theme will be shown.
4. If a child theme is active, its parent is indicated in parentheses.
