# MultiSyde

A WordPress plugin that explores potential improvements for WordPress Multisite.

Developed as part of Sydeâ€™s initiative to improve the Multisite experience by addressing usability, transparency, and network administration challenges.

## Vision and Purpose

Multisyde is a proof-of-concept plugin created by Syde to explore and demonstrate improvements to the WordPress Multisite experience.

Multisite is a powerful but often overlooked feature of WordPress. Our goal is to bring more visibility, usability, and flexibility to network administrators and developers working with Multisite networks - through small, focused improvements that solve real-world pain points.

This plugin exists to:
* Identify and prototype practical improvements for WordPress Multisite
* Spark conversations around long-standing issues and missing features
* Contribute ideas and feedback that may eventually inform core development
* Provide value to Network Admins and developers through improved workflows

We believe that even small changes - clearer UI, better network tools, developer helpers - can make a big impact in complex Multisite setups. This plugin is our way of testing those ideas out in the open.

## Features

Each [feature](./modules/README.md) is self-contained and documented in its respective directory under `modules/`, where you can find more details, including usage instructions and implementation notes.
